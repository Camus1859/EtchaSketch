## Here are the projects instructions:


***Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs***

***Create the divs using JavaScript… don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your html file!***
***Best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (that one can go directly in your html)***
   
  ***There are several different ways to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line) feel free to use any or play with each of them:***

***float/clear***
***inline-block***
***flexbox***
***CSS Grid***


***Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.***

***There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:***
***adding a new class to the div***
***changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.***
***Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid.*** 	***Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for*** 	***the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, resulting in possible delays, freezing, or*** 		***crashing that we want to prevent.***
